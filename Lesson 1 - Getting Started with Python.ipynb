    "Welcome to Learn Python Fast, Lesson 1: Getting Started with Python! This lesson (and, indeed, all the lessons in this training) is intended as a gentle, hands-on introduction to Python for people with little to no experience in object-oriented programming. We'll begin today by learning a bit about how to interact with Python. This lesson is necessarily (and unavoidably) on the long side -- so long, in fact, it had to be split in two. A lot of vocabulary will be introduced, which I try to highlight by **boldfacing** anything that's important to learn; don't worry if it's all a bit much, as there's a vocabulary section at the end, and you'll learn a lot by immersion."

    "### Lesson 1a: A Brief Introduction to Python\n",
    "#### What is a Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a language? It's a set of rules or principles governing communication between two or more entities (in this case, between you and your computer). Like any language, Python has nouns (things), verbs (actions you do to things), adverbs (describing the way nouns are verbed), and the like. Also like any language, learning Python takes a bit of time and immersion. You won't get it all right away, so be patient with yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most of what we think of as languages, Python (and, indeed, most computer languages) actually has a fairly limited vocabulary. That means you don't need to learn much to start being able to do useful things with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also unlike most languages, Python has no ambiguity (as far as the computer is concerned); the computer cannot misunderstand or misinterpret you. If you get an error, it's because you got something wrong. Fortunately, Python gives error messages when that happens, giving you an idea of what you might have done wrong and how to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, unlike most languages, Python has only one mood: the imperative. The entire language revolves around you giving instructions to your computer. And that's all a programming language is, fundamentally: a set of rules allowing you to communicate instructions to a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, as I said, is a programming language. Specifically, it's an *object-oriented* programming (OOP) language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other languages, like SQL, are said to be *declarative* languages, meaning that you tell the computer what you want to see without giving it detailed instructions about how to get it, and it does the rest. Still other languages are said to be *procedural* languages, where everything is thought about in terms of procedures that a computer executes. Python is *object-oriented* insofar as everything is conceived of as an **object**, that is, a structured data entity stored in a particular address in your computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a handy programming language because it is, in the words of Van Lindberg, \"the second best language for everything\". For any given task, there's probably a better language for it than Python, but Python is so flexible, adaptable, intuitive, and easy to learn that it's easily the second best choice for any task. Learning Python is a great way to dip your toes into programming and decide if it's something about which you'd like to learn more."

    "In the above case, we called the print() function with the argument \"Hello world!\". Python took the argument, plugged it into the appropriate parts of the print() function, and caused it to execute, resulting in the argument \"Hello world!\" being printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that not all functions require arguments and, indeed, some won't accept any, but even if calling a function without any arguments, it's still necessary to include empty parentheses after the function's name.

The second is the name of the error, in this case, NameError. The third is a short description of the error, telling us that the name of the object given, *greeting_invalid*, was not defined.

We do this by placing a backslash before the relevant character, as below (I choose to wrap the string in single-quotation marks so I only have to escape the mid-string apostrophe, but you could, if you prefer, wrap the string in double-quotation marks and then escape out the two instances of them that appear in the string)."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we learned a bit about what Python is at a high-level, then began learning about Python objects, functions, classes, and methods. We saw how all these concepts apply to a fundamental class in Python, the string class. In the next lesson, we'll continue learning about some of the basic Python classes, including integers, floats, complex numbers, and Boolean values. We'll also learn some more logical operators (e.g., to test if one number is greater than another), converting between data types, and some other neat tips and tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Object**: A programming construct in Python which represents a datum or collection of data.\n",
    "* **Function**: A reusable block of code which Python executes (or at least attempts to execute) whenever the function is called.\n",
    "* **Call**: The act of executing a function (or other callable object). This is done by referencing the name of the function followed by a set of parentheses. For instance, \"print\" references the function, but \"print()\" calls the function.\n",
    "* **Argument**: Inputs to a function supplied by the user when calling the function. Arguments are supplied to a function call inside the parentheses following the function's name. For instance, in the function call \"print('Hello world')\", the string 'Hello world!' is an argument to the print() function.\n",
    "* **Comment**: A short piece of non-code, usually intended as a description of code, created by prefacing some text with a hashtag (\"#\"). Such hashtags can also be used to \"comment out\" lines of code we want to disable without deleting.\n",
    "* **Assignment**: The act of associating a value *x* with a variable *y*, such that, when *y* is referenced, the value *x* is returned. When submitting the state *x = y*, we say that *y* is assigned to *x*.\n",
    "* **Operator**: A special character which tells Python to perform a particular operation. For instance, a plus sign '+' placed between two strings acts as a concatenation operator, telling Python to combine the two strings into one.\n",
    "* **Traceback**: A report produced by Python whenever an error is encountered that enables the user to trace the exact source of the error back to the code that caused it in the first place.\n",
    "* **Error**: A problem or ambiguity with Python code of such a nature that Python, uncertain of how to proceed, aborts execution of the code entirely.\n",
    "* **Class**: A very general, abstract template for an object, which determines exactly what that object represents and what can be done with it.\n",
    "* **String**: A type of class containing zero or more alphanumeric or other special characters.\n",
    "* **Variable**: A reserved location in a computer's memory containing a Python object. In the above assignment example *x = y*, the value in *y* is stored in the variable *x*. Variables must be named beginning with an alpha character (i.e., a letter) or an underscore.\n",
    "* **Literal**: A succinct and visually-sensible way of writing a value in Python; e.g., in *x = 'Hello'*, 'Hello' is a string-literal, recognizable as such by the quotation marks surrounding it. The variable *x* is then a string, but not, itself, a string-literal.\n",
    "* **Escape character**: A special character (in Python, the backslash '\\') which, when encountered in a string, tells the Python interpreter to interpret the next character in a special way. For instance, '\\n' tells Python to interpret the 'n' not as text but as a special instruction to insert a new line.\n",
    "* **Method**: A type of function proper to objects of a particular class. Because methods belong to all members of a particular class, they are called directly with variables of that class. For instance, the .upper() method can be called with string variables to capitalize all characters in the string, e.g., \"myString.upper()\".\n",
    "* **Dot notation**: The means of invoking a method on a particular object by naming the object, placing a period, and then calling the method. Dot notation allows multiple methods to be applied to the same object, one after another, simply by stringing them together with dot notation."
