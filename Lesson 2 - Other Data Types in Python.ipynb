    "\n",
    "Welcome back to Learn Python Fast, Lesson 2: Other Data Types in Python! In the last lesson, we gave a brief introduction to programming in general and Python in particular, then dove head-first into understanding Python objects, functions, classes, and methods, with a special focus on strings. Strings are a very common data type in Python, but they're not the only one, and in this lesson, we'll review some of the other most common classes you'll encounter. As before, we'll continue to **boldface** any important vocabulary, which will be covered at the end of the lesson."

That means x.real (and also x.imag) are not, properly speaking, methods: they're **attributes**. Attributes are to variables what methods are to functions: where methods are functions available to members of a particular class, attributes are variables which are populated the same way for members of a particular class. Specifically, in this case, the attribute real corresponds to the real-number component of x (which is 5) and the attribute imag corresponds to the imaginary-number component of x (which is 2). Attributes are called using dot-notation just like methods are, but because they aren't functions, we don't call them with parentheses; we simply name the attribute we want to use."

    "In this lesson, we built on what we learned previously, learning about new data types like integers, floats, complex numbers, and Boolean values, as well as learning about attributes, logical operators, and certain best practices. In our next session, we'll review another type of object in Python: iterables like lists and tuples, which are simply collections of objects."

    "### Vocabulary Covered in This Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integer**: A type of object representing whole numbers, such as 2 or -7.\n",
    "* **Float**: A type of object representing fractional numbers, such as 2.01 or -7.58.\n",
    "* **Complex Number**: A type of object representing numbers with real and imaginary components, such as 5 + 2i, where i is the imaginary square root of -1.\n",
    "* **Attributes**: A variable that belongs to a class, such that all members of the class have access to the same attribute. For instance, the class of complex numbers have attributes \"real\" (corresponding to the real number portion of the number) and \"imag\" (corresponding to the imaginary number portion of the number). Attributes are called using dot-notation, like with methods, but without parentheses, e.g., \"my_complex_number.real\".\n",
    "* **Boolean**: A type of representing truthfulness or falsehood, i.e., True or False; commonly returned by logical operators.\n",
    "* **Logical Operator**: A special type of operator which compares two variables (e.g., \"x > y\" to test if x is greater than y) and returns True or False.\n",
    "* **Comment**: A line or portion of a line of code set apart from the rest with a hashtag '#', which will Python will not attempt to execute.\n",
    "* **Docstring**: Essentially a multi-line comment, also set apart from execution, but opened and closed with a set of three quotation-marks."
